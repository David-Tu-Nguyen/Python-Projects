# mpg-auto

## Dataset Overview

The MPG dataset contains technical specifications of various automobiles, originally sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg). It focuses on analyzing fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (MPG), using a combination of three categorical and five numerical features.

## Column Descriptions
1. `mpg`: Fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (continuous).
2. `cylinders`: Number of engine cylinders (categorical, multi-valued).
3. `displacement`: Engine displacement size (continuous).
4. `horsepower`: Engine output power (continuous).
5. `weight`: Vehicle weight (continuous).
6. `acceleration`: Time taken to accelerate per second (continuous).
7. `model year`: Release year of the car, ranging from 1970 to 1982 (categorical, multi-valued).
8. `origin`: Region of manufacture (1 = USA, 2 = Europe, 3 = Asia) (categorical, multi-valued).
9. `car name`: Specific name of the car model (unique identifier for each record).
